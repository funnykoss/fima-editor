        "description": "With the beginning of the full-scale war of the russian federation against Ukraine I was in Kyiv filming what was happening to me and the people around me. I filmed my observations of others from my balcony, walked the streets, stood in the shop line and tried to put my life in a new reality. In the film I am reflecting on my feelings and life during a full-scale war. The film consists of videos I have been shooting during three months of full-scale war and my diary entries that I've been fixing all the time.",
